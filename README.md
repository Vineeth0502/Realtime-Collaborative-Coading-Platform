# Realtime-Collaborative-Coding-Platform
Project Summary: Our project aims to develop a cutting-edge Real-Time Collaborative Code Editing Platform to
address the challenges of modern software development collaboration. The platform facilitates seamless,
simultaneous code editing and communication among multiple developers. Leveraging socket programming, it
enables real-time synchronization of edits, empowering developers to collaborate effortlessly. With integrated
features like syntax highlighting, code formatting, and version control, the platform aims to streamline
workflows and enhance collaboration efficiency. The project will also include support for version history,
revision control, and integration with Git.
Methods: The implementation will involve utilizing advanced socket programming techniques to establish real-
time communication channels. The code editor component will be developed with features such as syntax
highlighting and formatting. Additionally, collaborative debugging features, including breakpoints and variable
inspection, will be incorporated to enhance the debugging process.
